## About GS Invaders

This game is a GS implementation of the original Space Invaders.  It is played using the joystick, and manipulated using the mouse.

Note: __It would be nice to add the ability to actually play with the mouse as well.  Pull requests are welcome.__

This was written back in late 1986, and ~~I am only now (July 91) getting around to releasing it~~__was released in July 1991__, simply because no one else ha~~s~~__d__ yet.  It was written more as a bit of fun than anything, when the best we had was SeaStrike and it's like.

I hope you like it.  

## Playing GS Invaders

When the game starts, the title screen will come up, with the score bar at the top of the screen.

In the score bar, you will see three buttons, PLAY, QUIT, and PAUSE.

Clicking on PLAY when the title screen is up, will commence play.  Otherwise it does nothing.

Clicking on QUIT when the title screen is up, will quit the program back to your launcher.  Clicking on QUIT during play will abort the game, and bring the title screen back.

Clicking on PAUSE when the title screen is up, will do nothing other than toggle the highlighting of the PAUSE button.  During play, PAUSE will freeze the game until the PAUSE button is clicked on again.

### Game Play

Once the action has started, the game plays true to the original, except for two things....

### The Mothership

When the mother ship appears, the screen background will change to a dark reddish colour.  While the mothership is present this will remain.  If you shoot the mother ship, it will continue until another mother ship appears.

While the background is non-black you will score extra points for each invader shot.

The mother ship may change direction at whim,  and each time it does, the background becomes a brighter red.  The will continue until: a) You shoot the mother ship. b) It dissapears. c) It turns too many times.

The brighter the red, the more bonus points you get.

### The Last Invader

When there is only one invader left on the screen, it does not simply walk horizontaly.  It begins travelling at a diagonal towards the bottom of the screen.

Enjoy!
